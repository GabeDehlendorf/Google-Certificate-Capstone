# Salifort Motors Employee Retention

## Overview
This project simulates the work of a data professional working at Salifort Motors tasked with finding out what to prioritize in order to increase employee retention.
The dataset includes a column for whether an employee has left, so supervised machine learning tactics were used.

## Key Components

* `Capstone Executive Summary`: This pdf summarizes the results of the analysis using language and visuals that are accessible for all levels of technical knowledge.

## Data Sources

The data file 'HR_capstone_dataset.csv' was provided by Google and, for each employee, contains columns indicating employee behaviors and histories. The following are the dependent and key independent variables after their renaming. A new column was also created called 'not_fired_hours'.
* `Dependent`: left
* `Independent`: satisfaction_level, avg_monthly_hours, salary, current_proj_num, not_fired_hours


## How to Use

The 'Capstone Executive Summary' file states the problem, plan, and findings of the data analysis which is all present in the 'Salifort Motors Employee Retention' jupyter notebook file.
