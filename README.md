# Google-Certificate-Capstone
This project, including a Jupyter notebook and executive summary, is the capstone at the end of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. The project integrates all that has been learned so far: python basics, EDA, visualizations, regression, and machine learning modeling as tools to uncover what prompts employees to leave a company.

# Salifort Motors Employee Retention

## Overview
This project simulates the work of a data professional working at Salifort Motors tasked with finding out what to prioritize in order to increase employee retention.
The dataset includes a column for whether an employee has left, so supervised machine learning tactics were used.

## Key Components

* `Deliverables`: The first deliverable is an outline of the project's order and the remaining deliverables are executive summaries of lab findings.
* `Labs`: Contains the python code used to conduct the data analysis and create the visualizations presented in deliverables 2-6.

## Data Sources

The data file 'Tiktok Data.csv' was provided by Google and, for each tiktok, contains many columns indicating tiktok properties and engagement levels. The following are the dependent and key independent variables for the project.
* `Dependent`: claim_status
* `Independent`: video_id, video_view_count, video_share_count, video_download_count, video_duration_sec


## How to Use

The deliverables show increasingly more advanced data analysis topics as the course continued on. The latter labs and deliverables apply the previously learned concepts with the latter labs providing the bulk of the project's work.
