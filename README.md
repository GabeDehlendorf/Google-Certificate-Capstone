# Google-Certificate-Capstone
This project, including a Jupyter notebook and executive summary, is the capstone at the end of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. The project integrates all that has been learned so far: python basics, EDA, visualizations, regression, and machine learning modeling as tools to uncover what prompts employees to leave a company.
