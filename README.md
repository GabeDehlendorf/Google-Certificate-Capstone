# Salifort Motors Employee Retention

## Overview
This project simulates the work of a data professional working at Salifort Motors tasked with finding out what to prioritize in order to increase employee retention.
The dataset includes a column for whether an employee has left, so supervised machine learning tactics were used.

## Key Components

* `Salifort Motors Employee Retention`: This file contains all of the python code used for the project, including the comparison of multiple machine learning models.
* `Capstone Executive Summary`: This pdf summarizes the results of the analysis using language and visuals that are accessible for all levels of technical knowledge.

## Data Sources

The data file 'HR_capstone_dataset.csv' was provided by Google and, for each employee, contains columns indicating employee behaviors and histories. The following are the dependent and key independent variables for the project.
* `Dependent`: left
* `Independent`: satisfaction_level, avg_monthly_hours


## How to Use

The deliverables show increasingly more advanced data analysis topics as the course continued on. The latter labs and deliverables apply the previously learned concepts with the latter labs providing the bulk of the project's work.
